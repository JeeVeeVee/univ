Surrounded by sequels and animated movies, Lucy stood out as a refreshingly original Summer movie. It wound up earning $126.7 million, which was above a handful of much pricier Summer movies like Edge of Tomorrow, Hercules and The Expendables 3.

It was also a massive success internationally, where it took in over $330 million. There probably won’t be a sequel – the story doesn’t really allow for that – but its success does seem to be generating more interest in female-centric action movies, which can only be a good thing.
