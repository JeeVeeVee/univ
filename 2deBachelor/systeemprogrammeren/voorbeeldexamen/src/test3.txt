The fourth installment in the Transformers franchise was the lowest-grossing one yet at the domestic box office, and was off a whopping 30 percent from its predecessor. So how did it make this list?

Simply put, because it was an overseas juggernaut. Thanks to a massive $300-million-plus haul in China, Transformers: Age of Extinction is the only 2014 release (so far) to earn over $1 billion worldwide. In fact, the race isn’t even close: the runner-up, Guardians of the Galaxy, is wrapping up with around $300 million less. Keep an eye out for a Transformers 5 announcement in the near future.
