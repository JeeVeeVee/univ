Maleficent earned a massive $241 million at the domestic box office: while that’s not quite on par with Alice in Wonderland, it’s above last year’s Oz the Great and Powerful. Even more impressive was its overseas haul, where it wrapped up with over $516 million (which will be enough to put it in the Top 5 for the year).

The movie’s success reaffirmed Angelina Jolie’s status as one of the most bankable performers working today, and also suggests that Disney’s strategy of mining their animated library for live-action content is a strong one. Next year, they’ll try this again with Cinderella and The Jungle Book.
