X-Men: Days of Future Past essentially matched the franchise high at the domestic box office ($233 million), which is a solid result. At the same time, though, it took the franchise to the next level at the international box office, where it earned over $500 million (nearly twice as much as the previous series record).

That put the movie well over the $700 million mark worldwide, which is a really sustainable level for a big-budget comic book franchise like this. Fox is moving forward aggressively with the next installment, X-Men: Apocalypse, which is on track to open in May 2016.
