Unless The Interview makes a stunning amount of money, 22 Jump Street will wind up being the highest-grossing comedy of the year with over $191 million. Remarkably, that’s a 39 percent improvement over its predecessor, which is nearly unheard of with sequels.

It also more than doubled 21 Jump Street’s international haul, leading to a total over $330 million. While the (very entertaining) end credit sequence seemed to rule out the possibility of a 23 Jump Street, I’m guessing they’ll find a clever way around that in the very near future.
