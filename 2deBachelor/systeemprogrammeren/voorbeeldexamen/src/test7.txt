Based on Gillian Flynn’s bestselling novel and directed by David Fincher, Gone Girl always looked like it was going to be a solid box office performer. But no one expected it to be this big.

After a strong $37 million debut, word-of-mouth turned Gone Girl in to the must-see adult movie of the Fall. It has never dropped more than 38 percent from one weekend to the next, and is on track to earn over $170 million total. That makes it Fincher’s highest-grossing movie ever, and it could even top Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar (a much more expensive – and more anticipated – movie).
