Everything is awesome about The LEGO Movie’s performance at the domestic (U.S.) box office, where the movie earned a stunning $257.8 million. That ranks first among animated movies this year ahead of How to Train Your Dragon 2, Big Hero 6 and more.

However, while it was also one of the highest-grossing movies of the year in the U.K. and Australia, it didn’t really connect in non-English-speaking countries. Still, that’s a minor mark against it, and Warner Bros. is forging ahead aggressively with sequels and spin-offs (Ninjago, LEGO Batman).
