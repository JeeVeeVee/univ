Ahead of release, Guardians of the Galaxy was viewed as the riskiest project yet in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: were people really going to see a movie starring a talking raccoon and an anthropomorphized tree? Moviegoers answered “yes” to the tune of over $330 million at the domestic box office, which will likely rank first for the year once all is said and done.

This wasn’t Marvel’s only hit this year, though. They also scored with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which earned over $700 million worldwide (nearly twice as much as its predecessor).
